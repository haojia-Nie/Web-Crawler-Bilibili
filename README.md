# Bilibili_scrapying_basic
A basic and straight-forward scraping for bilibili, good for beginners


The website used could be find by inspect the source code of the website https://space.bilibili.com, 
and we could find the user information in the network section under XHR, the data is provided in the 
form of a dictionary, and we just analyse it. 


Note: only can be used for you to scrap a small amout of data, anything more than that require multiprocessing
      and using headers and different proxies 
      
A small demo of the data I got:

Also, I use matplotlib and pandas for data visualisation
